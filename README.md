# File Metadata Microservice

A freecodecamp.org backend microservice project.


* User Story: I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.
* User Story: When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response

          
## Example output:
  
    {"name": 0001.jpg, "size": 592218}
